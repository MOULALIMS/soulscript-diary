// This file initializes Firebase services and exports them for use in the application
// It ensures that Firebase is only initialized once, even if this file is imported multiple times.
// The Firebase services initialized here include Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.
// The configuration values are sourced from environment variables for security and flexibility.
// This setup allows the application to interact with Firebase services without needing to reinitialize them,
// which is crucial for performance and avoiding potential issues with multiple initializations.
